# Chicken Game

# To do

game board

- show chicken / fox performance
- allow training to do 1000s of iterations without rendering

create chicken policy

- TD(lambda)
- more RL algorithms?

create visualizations

- chicken value function
- fox value functions

create about page

- about page modal for the entire site
- about page modal for each algorithm

create performance visualization

- chicken performance distribution
- fox performance distribution
- number of iterations

add a 'train' button to speed up training for X ticks

make actors objects persistent until explicitly reset
show number of games player per actor

use a web worker to make training non-blocking

double chicken?
portals!
