# Chicken Game

# To do

game board

- show chicken / fox performance
- allow training to do 1000s of iterations without rendering
- set breakpoint for N iterations to prevent infinite games

create chicken policy

- policy iteration
- value iteration
- monte carlo
- temporal difference
- TD(lambda)
- player input policy (?) do this last

create visualizations

- chicken value function
- fox value functions

create about page

- about page modal for the entire site
- about page modal for each algorithm

create performance visualization

- chicken performance distribution
- fox performance distribution
- number of iterations

add a 'train' button to speed up training for X ticks
